                <dt>Onboarding</dt>
                <dd>This is your entry point into your career at International Sports, where you are introduced to your team, ways of working, products, tools, and technologies. Make sure you ask lots of questions, meet as many people as possible and don't rush. Onboarding takes time, it's natural to feel like you have a mountain to climb. By working closely with your manager and team, and following your onboarding plan, you can take small steps towards starting to make an impact!</dd>

                <dt>Mastery</dt>
                <dd>Starting to build mastery in particular skills or technologies becomes invaluable as you start to build your career. Having mastered key skills and techniques, means you can draw on this experience as you start to get further away from the detail and your role and responsibility starts to widen. Gaining mastery is something which can't be rushed and comes with a combination of experience, learning and training. Ensure you always have a PDP you are working against and a mentor to guide you and you will naturally build mastery.</dd>

                <dt>Craft</dt>
                <dd>Learning and becoming proficient in your craft is one of the first steppingstones in your career and allows you to build on this as you start looking forward to mastery and specialisation. Ensure you are working with your manager and mentor to help build your craft, asking for and acting on any feedback to help learn and improve.</dd>

                <dt>Experience</dt>
                <dd>It's important to use your early career to build knowledge, experiencing as many different aspects of your role as possible. This will help your business foundations, giving you an excellent starting base to build upon as your career progresses.</dd>

                <dt>Learning</dt>
                <dd>Learning can come from many sources, whether that's from your team/mentor or selflearning; remaining receptive to these channels and opportunities is important. Every experience is a learning opportunity, often learning more from our mistakes than our successes. Discuss your personal development with your manager and get a PDP (Personal Development Plan) in place, this will allow you to accelerate your learning, ensuring your focus is directed and supported with the right tools.</dd>

                <dt>Training</dt>
                <dd>Training is an important part of your career, allowing you to take time out for indepth learning and to get certified for key parts of your role. You will be enrolled on many training courses automatically by our Learning & Development (L&D) team, we encourage you to attend as many of these as possible. You also have a Â£2000 (or currency equivalent) per year L&D budget that you can put towards any training. This will allow you to gain any certifications or attend conferences to enhance your skills and experience.</dd>

                <dt>Mentor</dt>
                <dd>One of the fastest ways to accelerate your learning is to find a mentor. Finding someone with who you can ask for advice, discuss your personal development, give you critical feedback and coach you, is an invaluable addition to your career plan. Speak to your manager about finding a mentor, and think about people you might look up to, who have skills you admire - someone who you can picture yourself learning from easily is key.</dd>

                <dt>Specialisation</dt>
                <dd>One of the final areas within the Early Careers Zone is the Specialisation area. By taking in everything you have learned in the other areas, you can start to decide where best to specialise. This might be focusing on specific technologies or looking for opportunities to start gaining experience in other areas.</dd>
